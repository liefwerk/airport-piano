Airport piano is a website that helps you find free playable instruments around the world.

## :bulb: What is the idea behind this project?

Making access to intruments easier for players around the world. This idea came to me when I was traveling in South America and especially when I really wanted to play/practice the piano. Long story short, it took me several weeks aksing around several cities to finally find a tuned piano, hidden inside a shopping hall in the city center.
